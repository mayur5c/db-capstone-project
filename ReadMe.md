Through following along with the video lectures and prescribed readings, you have gained a comprehensive overview of how to build the various components required for creating a booking system that can be utilized by Little Lemon.

As part of the final assessment criteria, you were provided with some sample booking data that you were asked to save to a database. To create a successful Booking implementation, you were asked to complete the following actions:

Create a database that holds the data.

Connect to the database using a Python client.

Create a procedure using Python to react to changes in the data.

Connect to the database using Tableau.

Generate data reports using Tableau.

You will now present your application for peer review. As part of engaging with the peer review process, you are asked to submit your application to the system to be evaluated. In addition, you are asked to review two applications from your peers.

# Review criteria

In addition you also need to analyze data using the following Little Lemon data file:


Once you have created the appropriate models, database schema, and completed the data analysis in Tableau, you then need to commit the project to your GitHub and upload the link.

Your project is expected to include the following items:

Relevant diagrams and screenshots in PNG format.

The data model you produced in MySQL Workbench.

The SQL file of the Little Lemon database schema.

The workbook that includes all worksheets and dashboards.


How to Review
Once you have submitted your own application, you are required to evaluate two projects submitted by your peers.
